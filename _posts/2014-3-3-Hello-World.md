title: Unpacking the Mechanics of the Binomial Distrobution
---


When you flip a coin you have two possible outcomes, heads or tails. Each outcome has a distinct chance of showing up, and in this case the chance is one in two for both. Now consider flipping the coin a second time. When you flip a coin twice, the amount of possible outcomes increases, in particular, you go from just two possible outcomes to four. Like before, each possible outcome has a distinct probability of occurring. But what if you wanted to know a more general outcome, like the chance of getting heads only one time, instead of a more specific outcome, like getting tails first and then heads second. For that, you would need to use the binomial distribution.
The binomial distribution is the probability distribution of the number of successes obtained in a fixed number of trials, where each success has a fixed probability of occurring. From the example above, the trial is the coin flip, which is run a fixed value of two times, and obtaining a head is considered a success, which occurs with a fixed probability of one in two.
